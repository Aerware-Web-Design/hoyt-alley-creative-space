					<p>Sky Carver, a native Alaskan, spent his formative years immersed in the rugged activities of the Last Frontier: hunting, fishing, skiing, snow machining, and boating. But his path diverged when he set his sights on becoming a real estate developer and owner during high school, enticed by the promise of passive income. Little did he know, this ambition would initially lead him astray.</p>
					<p>Despite the rocky start, Sky eventually found himself entrenched in the real estate industry, managing buildings and overseeing a medical facility with a reputable tenant in the rehabilitation business. When the opportunity arose to partner with a growing nationwide rehab enterprise in Everett, Sky eagerly pursued it. However, fate had other plans.</p>
					<p>A hastily-signed lease and an unforeseen municipal ordinance banning rehab clinics in downtown Everett left Sky facing a daunting predicament. Undeterred, he turned to creativity as his ally.</p>
